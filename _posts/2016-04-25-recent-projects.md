# Using Big Data to Predict Brexit

Using Python and R, I accessed and analyzed JSON data from popular immigration-related petitions on Westminster's online platform. I then used QGIS to map one million signers by constituency. Results indicate strong correlation to Brexit referendum election results. My visualizations were presented by Dr. Margetts for her May 2016 _Political Turbulence_ talks at Harvard and MIT.
