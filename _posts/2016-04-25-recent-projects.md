  Using Python and R, I accessed and analyzed data from popular
  immigration-related petitions on the UKâ€™s online platform. I then used QGIS to
  map one million signers by constituency. Results indicate strong correlation

Using Python and R, I accessed and analyzed data from popular immigration-related petitions on the UK's online platform. I then used QGIS to map one million signers by constituency. Results indicate strong correlation to Brexit referendum election results. My visualizations were presented by Dr. Margetts for her May 2016 _Political Turbulence_ talks at Harvard and MIT.
