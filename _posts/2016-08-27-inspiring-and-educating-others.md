# Inspiring and educating others

Tasked with booking guest speakers, I sought to connect popular culture with activism by inviting **Piper Kerman**, the American memoirist whose prison experiences provided the basis for the Netflix comedy-drama _Orange Is the New Black._

### It remains the most attended guest speaker event on campus in over a decade.
