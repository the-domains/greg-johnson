# Hi, I'm Greg.

I study the Internet at Oxford University (anticipated graduation: August 2016). My research focus is on strategies to convert lurkers on social media and community-oriented platforms into active participants. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems - I achieve this with my experience in entrepreneurial settings, managing large budgets, team leadership, and big data analysis.
